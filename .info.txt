TODO
    *******change keys from letters to more obscure characters so keyboard input is less likely to be registered as controller input 

    add system-wide zoom function 

    create some kind of graphical alert of which mode the controller is currently in 

    consollidate the .txt IO files into JSON and add read/write functionality w/ JSON

    fix 'object key has no attribute char error' in on_press event 

    add a more readable launcher than rofi 

    write docs
    
    remove the qjoypad layer altogether and read controller binary directly
